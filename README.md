# Software environment for CodeRefinery.

This git repository is suitable for the Binder service to create a
software environment suitable for CodeRefinery lessons.  (Note: this
is still under development, things aren't fully installed or testyet yet.)

Note that after a few hours maximum (or a few hours of inactivity),
all data is destroyed from here.  This is a public service, so don't
trust this with data security.
